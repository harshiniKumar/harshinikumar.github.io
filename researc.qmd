## Foundation Model Research

My research in foundation models focuses on improving efficiency and applicability of large language models across diverse domains.

### Current Projects

#### Efficient Fine-tuning for Domain Adaptation

This project explores techniques to efficiently adapt pre-trained foundation models to specific domains with minimal computational resources. Key innovations include:

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methodologies (LoRA, QLoRA, Adapters)
- Quantization approaches that preserve model quality
- Selective layer updates based on task requirements
- Memory-efficient training algorithms

**Status**: Currently evaluating performance trade-offs across multiple model architectures.

#### Explainable Foundation Models

This research stream focuses on making foundation model decisions more transparent and interpretable. We're developing:

- Attention visualization tools that highlight influential tokens
- Counterfactual explanation generators
- Saliency mapping for important input features
- Model-agnostic interpretation mechanisms

### Collaborative Work

I collaborate with researchers across disciplines to apply foundation models to specialized domains:

- **Healthcare**: Adapting models for medical text processing while maintaining privacy
- **Legal**: Building tools for legal document analysis and case summarization
- **Scientific Literature**: Developing systems to assist with research paper understanding and synthesis

## Statistical Modeling

My statistical modeling work emphasizes rigorous methodologies and uncertainty quantification.

### Bayesian Approaches

I employ Bayesian methods to quantify uncertainty in model predictions and parameter estimates:

- Hierarchical modeling for complex data structures
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations
- Probabilistic programming with Stan and PyMC
- Prior sensitivity analysis

### Reproducible Research Practices

I'm committed to improving research reproducibility through:

- Open code and data sharing
- Pre-registration of analysis plans
- Robust statistical practices that avoid p-hacking
- Comprehensive reporting of methods and results
